    + Can be viewed different ways - grid, Gantt chart, cards
    + Formulas can be used for aggregation
    + Can attach files and manage conversations
    + Can setup automated workflows
    
2. Forms: Collection information and take action
    + standardize data collection

3. Reports: Manage work across multiple sheets
    + Work across sheets with bi-directional, high level view
    + Reports are bi-directional
    + grid, calendar or gannt view
    + share as PDF or publish
    + display on dashboard
    
4. Dashboards
    + Surface key metrics without exposing underlying data
    + Use as a portal for centralzing resources for your team
    + Live, real-time updates to data as it changes
    + Charts
    + Embed web content

# Dashboards part 1 - Preparing data

SOURCE: https://help.smartsheet.com/learning-track/best-practice-webinars/dashboards-part-1-preparing-data

Before you build:

* Know your audience
* Define your purpose
* Create your data
    + Sheet summary with formula
    + Metrics sheet with cross-sheet formulas and cell linking
    + Reports

## Prepare sheet data

Use **Sheet Summary** to organize and report on critical sheet data

## Work across sheets

Use **reports** to consolodate key information from multiple sheets into a single overview.

Create a **roll-up sheet** to understand program performance.
