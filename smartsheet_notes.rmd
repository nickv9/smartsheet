    + Can be viewed different ways - grid, Gantt chart, cards
    + Formulas can be used for aggregation
    + Can attach files and manage conversations
    + Can setup automated workflows
    
2. Forms: Collection information and take action
    + standardize data collection

3. Reports: Manage work across multiple sheets
    + Work across sheets with bi-directional, high level view
    + Reports are bi-directional
    + grid, calendar or gannt view
    + share as PDF or publish
    + display on dashboard
    
4. Dashboards
    + Surface key metrics without exposing underlying data
    + Use as a portal for centralzing resources for your team
    + Live, real-time updates to data as it changes
    + Charts

Before you build:

* Know your audience
* Define your purpose
* Create your data
    + Sheet summary with formula
    + Metrics sheet with cross-sheet formulas and cell linking
    + Reports

## Prepare sheet data

Use **Sheet Summary** to organize and report on critical sheet data

## Work across sheets

# Questions

1. Q: Do workspaces contain copies of work sheets or "links' to the actual content?
    A: Workspaces aggregate sheets into a single view that makes it easier to assign permisions, share with a group, etc. The sheets themselves live outside workspaces.


# TODO
For my projects

* Establish relationships/dependencies between tasks
* Establish critical path
