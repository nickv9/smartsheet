4 major building blocks:

1. Sheets: The foundation of smartsheet
    + Can be viewed different ways - grid, Gantt chart, cards
    + Formulas can be used for aggregation
    + Can attach files and manage conversations
    + Can setup automated workflows
    
2. Forms: Collection information and take action
    + standardize data collection

3. Reports: Manage work across multiple sheets
    + Work across sheets with bi-directional, high level view
    + Reports are bi-directional
    + grid, calendar or gannt view
    + share as PDF or publish
    + display on dashboard
    
4. Dashboards
    + Surface key metrics without exposing underlying data
    + Use as a portal for centralzing resources for your team
    + Live, real-time updates to data as it changes
    + Charts
    + Embed web content
